    <<~EOS
      Finish the install:

        akasha setup

      It scans for credentials, vaults them on confirmation, registers the
      daemon as a login service, and writes the MCP config for Claude Code.

      On Linux, unlock a Secret Service keyring (gnome-keyring over D-Bus)
      before setup, and install bubblewrap for `akasha run`:
        https://github.com/inferlabshq/akasha/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#linux-prerequisites

      After `brew upgrade akasha`:  akasha stop && akasha start
      On Linux the systemd unit records the versioned Cellar path, so after an
      upgrade there run `akasha setup` again to re-register the service.

      Alpha: do not use it to protect secrets you cannot rotate.
